<h3>This is a react-website having:</h3>
<p><b>Elements like:</b> A Landing Page, Movie catalogue, About Page, Registration Page and a Login page.</p>
<span style="color: green">To make this website work like butter and at the same time make it attractive and interactive was really a tough task for me. I used the Core concepts of "React.js" along with CSS, Javascript and a bit of bootstrap as well. Moreover, I used "Formik" along with "Yup" for form Validation. I created my API from where I'm fetching the data for cards. The Website has a beautiful react-bootstrap Carousel which shows some featured movies and after that we have a navbar holding the filter function which allows you to select a category of your choice and it will automatically display only those movies which are related to that category.</span>
